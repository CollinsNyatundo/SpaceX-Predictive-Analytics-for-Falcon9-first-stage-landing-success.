## Project Description

This project focuses on utilizing historical data from Falcon 9 launches to predict the success of first-stage landings. The analysis includes a thorough examination of various factors that may influence landing success, such as launch site, rocket configuration, and weather conditions. The goal is to build robust predictive models that can assist SpaceX in optimizing their landing strategies.

### Key Steps in the Project:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and compiling historical launch data from various sources, including SpaceX's official launch logs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset that may influence landing success.
4. **Model Development**: Building and training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict landing success.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Results Interpretation**: Analyzing the results to derive actionable insights and recommendations for improving landing success rates.
